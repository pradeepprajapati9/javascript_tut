6)JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform.


Execution Process:
Interpreter: 
Reads and executes code line-by-line, translating each line into machine code or an intermediate representation on the fly.
Slower execution since it translates and executes code simultaneously.
More portable as it can run on any platform with the corresponding interpreter installed.
Easier to debug since errors are reported as they occur during execution.
Typically consumes less memory since it doesn't need to store compiled code.
Examples:Python, JavaScript (in browsers), Ruby.
Better for interactive development and scripting.
You often need to distribute the source code along with the interpreter.
Quick startup time as it doesn't require compilation.
Web scripting (JavaScript), quick prototyping (Python).



Compiler:
 Scans the entire source code first, translates it into machine code or another intermediate language, and then executes the compiled code.
Speed:
Faster execution as it compiles the code before running it.
Portability:
Less portable as it generates platform-specific binaries.
Debugging
Harder to debug since errors may not be reported until after compilation.
Memory Usage:
May require more memory to store the compiled binary.
Examples: C, C++, Rust.
Better for large-scale applications and performance-critical software.
Distribution
Distributes standalone executables, reducing the need to share source code.
Startup Time
Slower startup time due to the compilation step.
Popular Use Cases
System software, games, performance-critical applications.

including parsing and formatting JSON, working with arrays and objects, and performing calculations.
7) a javascript is interpreted languages and it is not compiled lang uages.
