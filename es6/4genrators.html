    <!-- a genrators is used to itrate the value like loop but loop is out of controll when we print 
    the value loop all print the value till condition is false 
     but from genrators we can control the print value and we can skip the value  but it is not 
    possible skip and controll by loop so this is the reason that we use genrators  -->
